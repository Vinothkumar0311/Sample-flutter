Local storage tips:
If you have a huge amount of structured data, go for SQLite.
If you want to store just some boolean or integer, go for Shared Preferences.
If you want to store private or classified data, go for Secure Storage
If you have a huge amount of data or Dart classes and don't want to worry about the structure much, go for Hive.
